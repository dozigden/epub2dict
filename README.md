This is not a generic tool.

I wrote it to convert a particular epub into a dictionary for a kobo ereader.  The vagaries of epubs format (basically html) would make genericising it challenging, but it might be useful from someone doing the same thing.

Unzipped contents of the epub go in 'source'

Run the .net app

Run make-dict.ps1 to index and compress dictionary

Is currently a hodge podge of windows and unix, so requires WSL to execute.
